      <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
      <p>
        We are committed to delivering the best.
        <br />
        <br />
        We understand that sometimes plans change. If you can no longer attend the class, please email us in advance at helpmission1success@gmail.com. Refunds will be processed according to the policies outlined below. We strive to maintain the highest standards of quality, and as with everything we do at Debashish, you receive a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.
        <br />
        <br />
        POLICY A
        <br />
        <br />
        Policy A applies to all Debashish courses under the categories of Digital Marketing, Data Science, and Python.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cancellations Prior to the Course
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are unable to attend the course and request a refund before the course start date, we will refund the full amount.
        <br />
        <br />
        Withdrawals During the Course
        <br />
        <br />
        If you do not find the value you expected in our product and choose to withdraw within the first two classes, we will issue a 100% refund—no questions asked. However, if you have attended more than two days of the course, you will not be eligible for a refund.
        <br />
        <br />
        No admission transfers from one learner to another.
        <br />
        <br />
        Transfers to Another Batch
        <br />
        <br />
        You may change your batch at any time before the course begins, at no extra cost. If you are unable to continue or complete the course, we will gladly accommodate you in a different batch of the same course, also at no additional cost.
        <br />
        <br />
        POLICY B
        <br />
        <br />
        Policy B applies to all Self-Paced Programs (E-Learning Programs) offered by Debashish. Cancellations will be permitted as per:

        <br />
        If you wish to extend access to an e-learning program by one month, please write to us at helpmission1success@gmail.com. We will extend the program for a maximum of one month at no cost. For extensions beyond one month, a fee of 50% of the course price will apply.
        <br />
        <br />
        NOTE:
        <br />
        <br />
        All cancellation, rescheduling, and substitution requests must be submitted via email to helpmission1success@gmail.com.
        <br />
        <br />
        You are not eligible for a refund if you have accessed or downloaded the course material.
        <br />
        <br />
        All refunds will be credited to your account within 10–15 business days of the refund request.
        <br />
        <br />
        Refunds or credits for rescheduling cannot be issued for non-attendance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Debashish may modify its refund policy at any time without notice. However, the refund policy in effect at the time of your transaction will apply to that purchase, regardless of future changes.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you do not notify us in writing about your cancellation or reschedule, or if you do not attend the training, you will not be eligible for a refund or rescheduling.
        <br />
